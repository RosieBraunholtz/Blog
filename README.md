# Astronomy Blog by Rosie Braunholtz

This blog was made using the Jekyll theme "Clean Blog" :

"[Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog Jekyll](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog-jekyll/) - Official Jekyll Version"

" [Clean Blog Jekyll](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog-jekyll/) is a stylish, responsive blog theme for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/). This theme features a blog homepage, about page, contact page, and an example post page along with a working contact form powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)."

I've simply used this theme and added my own content to it. The instructions on how to use this theme are on the git hub page: https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll.

You will need to download all the prerequisites first: Jekyll, Ruby Git etc. See here: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll.
