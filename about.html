<p> (Stephen Fry voice) Space is big, really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. And it seems there's a lot 
    of space to talk about, and not enough people to talk about it. Which is why I have selflessly taken up the role of science communicator for my 
    fellow peers. It's a hard job, but without me, where else are my fans going to read a 1000 word monthly post on something they could have probably 
    read on New Scientist by someone more articulate. The people need me! </p>

    <p> If you'd like to know a bit more about me, I'm an astronomy graduate currently exploring the world of work. You can head to my website
         which is linked in the navigation bar, where you can find my portfolio and more information. If you'd like to know how I made this blog
        I used GitHub pages and Jekyll Themes. Check out my Github Profile on the Contact page to find the source code. </p>
    
   <p> You may be thinking "ah, another 20-something year old starting a blog, nothing original". And you'd be right! But alas not everything can be exceptional. 
     So here we have a
     "regular" blog with standard content. Written from a corner of the Universe by a small ant, who sometimes looks up at the stars and wonders what life 
     is all about. Enjoy!
